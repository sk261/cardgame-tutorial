## Project: Blackjack Implementation

### Topic: Challenges in the project
Response: I had a hard time, emotionally, working on this project. I set high standards, but personal events came up that reduced the time I had to work on this project. My primary focus was to build a larger game, but I ended up turning the game into a basic blackjack. Some of the requirements for the project were not met, and I feel that a lack of time was the main cause.

### Topic: Advice to future student on this project
Response: I approached this project by building a basic layout to be editted later. I wrote out the steps of the game and what should happen at each step, then split the process of changing phases in the game and the active effects of the game so I could manage what the player would interact with versus what happens at the start of each step. This made the dealer handling and card count super easy. Given more work, this would be great for dealer AI to do all the behind-the-scenes work.

### Topic: Most fun aspects of this assignment
Response: I said this before, &quot;Adding my own flare...&quot; I liked having little chips to bet with instead of just a number. I liked the user drawing their cards instead of pressing a hit button. I&#39;d love to have spent more time finishing the project to add more flare to it.

### Topic: Most challenging aspects of this assignment
Response: Hurrying with a short amount of time while being utterly exhausted.

### Topic: Most difficult part of the assignment to understand
Response: What was essential and what was passible. I have a strong understanding of data structures from my previous data structures class, but having to manage a unity project instead of directly tackling the data structure samples made for a difficult time figuring where I should invest my time. I felt like I rarely used lists and used them very poorly simply to say I have used lists or list like objects.

### Topic: Improving the assignment in the future
Response: I think this project was perfect. If I had more time to work on it, I would have made the project far more complex and had way more fun working on it.
