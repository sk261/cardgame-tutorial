## Project: Card Game Tutorial

### Topic: Challenges in the project
Response: Having experience in Unity, I decided to start from scratch without the tutorial to build up something based on my knowledge of Unity, while learning new utilities along the way. I wanted to build something in 3d, and wanted to learn more about ray-casting and momentum. After setting up a basic 3d environment, I had to set up selection and positioning for the objects the player will be selecting. After implementing a basic ray-cast , I wanted to be able to drag/drop cards near key points and have them move to these places, such as the play area. Implementing rotation of the cards was a challenge, as I had to relearn quaternions. I copped out and ended up using Euler angles.

### Topic: Advice to future student on this project
Response: Place a background down first. Then, set up your camera so it observes the background for your game. Start placing objects, while making sure the objects are within the range/area that you&#39;d like. Once your project looks acceptable, start setting up collisions, gravity, etc. Test it during these steps to make sure nothing falls into crazy directions. Don&#39;t be afraid to rotate everything if gravity isn&#39;t working just right. Then, start adding functionality. Stick with individual object scripts, things like dragging the card can be made directly on the card. Once the project is done enough to turn in, add &#39;flare&#39;. Flare should be things that you want to see in the project. Maybe it&#39;s spinning cards, or colour changing cards/effects. Stick to one &#39;flare&#39; at a time. If you run into problems, don&#39;t be afraid to google it or ask for help.

### Topic: Most fun aspects of this assignment
Response: Adding my own flare, and seeing the project working. I loved playing with the bugs when they were first prevalent.

### Topic: Most challenging aspects of this assignment
Response: Remembering Unity was an overall challenging experience. I tried to avoid using tutorials and just stick with what I knew. A lot of lines of code I used to use are considered obsolete by Unity&#39;s standards now.

### Topic: Most difficult part of the assignment to understand
Response: Originally, I thought we had to follow the tutorial to the letter. I skipped to the end of the video and was very dissatisfied with their end results. There was a brief period of time where I was confused if we had to follow the tutorial, or if the end goal was to just make a shell for a card game. After speaking with the professor, I understood that I just had to make a card game shell: A deck, the ability to draw cards, and the ability to drag cards.

### Topic: Improving the assignment in the future
Response: Although the tutorial is nice, the assignment should feature the main goals of the project as what features are needed. I, personally, would rather have heard, &quot;Your project has to have the ability to do X, Y, and Z. You can use the tutorial to help.&quot; Instead of, &quot;Follow this tutorial.&quot; I, personally, like freedom in my projects.
