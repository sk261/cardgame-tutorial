## Project: Deck, Poke Deck, Card, and Poker Cards

### Topic: Challenges in the project
Response: Trying to manipulate and use the C# linked list was a chore. I ended up going through a brief "I give up" phase before going back to it and just dealing with what C# offers. I discovered how to manipulate it in a better way, but elected to do something simple for the sake of the project. I'm feeling more comfortable with Unity, but getting the screen to display the UI just right is still becoming somewhat challenging.

### Topic: Advice to future student on this project
Response: Focus entirely on C#, and then implement the Unity stuff afterwards. If you're struggling, seek help.

### Topic: Most fun aspects of this assignment
Response: Another student needed assistance on the project. I genuinely enjoyed spending time with them to bring them to a point where they felt comfortable with the material. We spent about 6 hours together, as I explained concepts, we walked through code together, we used actual playing cards to represent certain processes, and we figured out this project together. I know it wasn't the project directly, but I did enjoy the teaching opportunity. I, also, pushed for a C# focused project for them to keep Unity as it's own beast, and it worked out really well because she had something useable right away.

### Topic: Most challenging aspects of this assignment
Response: Using C#'s linked list was the most challenging part, just because it's so different from Linked Lists I've used before. Even the Union function doesn't seem to work right.

### Topic: Most difficult part of the assignment to understand
Response: The sample code given seemed a bit crazy, and I felt a need to program it myself. Walking through the sample code and project for the other student was nightmarish, but it was nice that most of the functionality was there for them to build off of. Maybe seeing it made the problems more complex for me, so this is definitely a personal challenge I had with the assignment.

### Topic: Improving the assignment in the future
Response: 6 hours for a novice student with a tutor's help to finish the project isn't that bad. I feel like a single person, without a tutor's help, should spend about 2x the unit value of the class in hours on homework. For Data Structures, a 4 unit class, that means 8 hours per week on homework. I think this means that the struggling students are SUPER struggling if they needed 6 hours of guided assistance. I have no idea how much time they spent solo working on these projects. I feel these projects should have a better difficulty gradient for the struggling students, or perhaps more resources available to them so they can reach out to TAs, tutors, etc. It was just by chance that I was in the class with them and offered to help, it shouldn't be by luck that struggling students succeed in this class. I'm unaware of what it looks like on your side, though.
